# GuessNumber
To build the C++ code for the "guess the number" game, you'll need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Here are the steps to build the code:

1. **Write the Code**: First, create a new text file and copy the C++ code provided in the previous response into it. You can use any text editor for this purpose, such as Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc. Save the file with a `.cpp` extension, for example, `guess_number.cpp`.

2. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**: Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

3. **Navigate to the Directory Containing the Code**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved your `guess_number.cpp` file.

4. **Compile the Code**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the code. If you have `g++` installed (a popular C++ compiler on Unix-like systems), you can compile the code by running the following command:

   ```
   g++ guess_number.cpp -o guess_number
   ```

   This command tells the compiler (`g++`) to compile the `guess_number.cpp` file and generate an executable named `guess_number`.

5. **Run the Executable**: After compiling successfully, you'll find an executable file named `guess_number` (or whatever name you specified after the `-o` option). You can run this executable by simply typing its name in the terminal/command prompt and pressing Enter:

   ```
   ./guess_number
   ```

6. **Play the Game**: Once you run the executable, the game should start, and you can follow the prompts to play the "guess the number" game.

These steps assume you're using a Unix-like system (such as Linux or macOS) or Windows with a compatible terminal emulator. If you're using a different compiler or development environment, the specific steps might vary, but the general process remains similar: write code, compile it, and then run the resulting executable.
